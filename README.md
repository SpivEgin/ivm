# ivm

This repository began as a GitHub fork of [tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n).
Simple flavour of node binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just _simple_.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g ivm

or

    $ make install
    
to `$HOME`. Prefix later calls to `ivm` with `N_PREFIX=$HOME`

    $ PREFIX=$HOME make install

### Installing Binaries

Install a few nodes:

    $ ivm 0.8.14
    $ ivm 0.8.17
    $ ivm 0.9.6

Type `ivm` to prompt selection of an installed node. Use the up /
down arrow to navigate, and press enter or the right arrow to
select, or ^C to cancel:

    $ ivm

      1.0.0
    Î¿ 1.0.1
      1.1.1

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ ivm latest

Use or install the stable official release:

    $ ivm stable

Switch to the previous version you were using:

    $ ivm prev

### Removing Binaries

Remove some versions:

    $ ivm rm 1.0.0 v1.0.1

Instead of using `rm` we can simply use `-`:

    $ n - 1.0.0

### Binary Usage

When running multiple versions of node, we can target
them directly by asking `n` for the binary path:

    $ n bin 1.0.0
    /usr/local/n/versions/1.0.0/bin/iojs

Or by using a specific version through `n`'s `use` sub-command:

    $ n use 1.0.0 some.js

with flags:

    $ n as 1.0.0 --debug some.js

## Usage

 Output from `ivm --help`:

    Usage: ivm [options] [COMMAND] [args]

    Commands:

      ivm                            Output versions installed
      ivm latest                     Install or activate the latest node release
      ivm stable                     Install or activate the latest stable node release
      ivm <version>                  Install node <version>
      ivm use <version> [args ...]   Execute node <version> with [args ...]
      ivm bin <version>              Output bin path for <version>
      ivm rm <version ...>           Remove the given version(s)
      ivm --latest                   Output the latest node version available
      ivm --stable                   Output the latest stable node version available
      ivm ls                         Output the versions of node available

    Options:

      -V, --version   Output current version of n
      -h, --help      Display help information

    Aliases:

      which   bin
      use     as
      list    ls
      -       rm

## Details

 `ivm` by default installs node to _/usr/local/n/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously installed versions of node when `ivm <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated nodes are then installed to the prefix _/usr/local_, which of course may be altered via the __N_PREFIX__ environment variable.

 To alter where `ivm` operates simply export __N_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
